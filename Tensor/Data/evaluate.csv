2,1,Season 1 shows that the suns energy is far away which causes earths surface to be colder season 2 shows the suns energy is closer to earths surface causing it to be warmer.
7,1,"your shadow is largest in the summer while the sun is tilted , and the sun is closest to earth in spring/summer"
8,1,I selected this answer because season 1 shows the sun hitting the green surface more directly which would cause the green surface to be hotter than if the sunlight and heat was more spread out like in season 2.
12,1,The first one is spring because it is directly above the earths surface and that means that it will be hot and the second one is summer because it is not directly above it and and the rays will hit all of the area.
15,1,sun was beating on earths surface
17,1,the winter is lower sun summer is higher sun / 
27,0,Because it is a warm season.  
28,0,I choose this answer because the Earth and Sun are opposites so there seasons would be opposite's as well. Also because the Sun would be mostly hot so the Earth would be winter.
43,0,the more tilted one dosent shine on the hole earth 
52,0,"I don't really have an answer to why I chose this. To he honest, I forget what the answer to this one would be..."
56,0,"I selected this answer because in figure 1 it showed the sun far away from the earth. And figure two the sun was about half and half, so that would make them winter and spring."
57,0,The position of the sun is different and not as direct in spring but the sun is more direct in winter. 
58,0,"The two diagrams are similar, meaning that there cannot be a season in between the two diagrams."
69,0,I selected this answer because during spring the sunlight covers a lower amount of earths surface than in the summer also during winter there is even less coverage than during spring and summer.  
77,0,Because I think the sun would be right in front of us in summer and winter and to the side for spring and fall.
80,0,"When you throw a ball on the ground during winter, the ball will usually bounce straight up. When you throw a ball at the ground during the summer the ball will bounce up at an angle because the ground is softer in the summer."
90,0,"I guessed because the diagram is really more like the kind that helps you determine what time it is. If that was the case it would be 1, afternoon and 2, evening. Maybe 3ish and half past 6ish. "
92,0,Spring comes before summer
99,0,Best One
103,0,idk
106,0,"I believe that the first picture is winter, because the sun is only spread in a small area, but on the second one, the sun's heat or rays is spread over a larger area."
