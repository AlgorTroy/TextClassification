1,I selected this answer because I think that in winter the sun is straight above your head and in summer the sun is at an angle.,2
1,I chose these answers because I know that when it's summer the sun shines on Earth at an angle and when it's winter the sun shines directly an the Earth. ,3
0,I guessed ,4
0,how the sun is placed because if theres a lot of sun it must be summer and if theres hardly no sun it must be winter / ,5
0,in the first one the sun is father away from the earth and the one is closer it the earth ,6
0,there is one winter each year and you get summer twice,7
1,I believe that the 1st picture is winter & the 2nd one is summer because during the summer months I feel as if the sun is at a further distance than in the winter months. Therefore I chose number 2 for summer because the sun is at a slant.,8
1,Number one is pointing directly on the earths surface and number two is pointing at an angle and I think when the sun is pointing directly down the sun isn't as hot.,9
0,I picked the fourth question because in example number one is more together but it douses not cover the entire ground but while number two is more sped out.    ,10
0,I thin the answer is Spring then Summer because the farther away the sun is from earth the colder it is. The closer the sun is to earth the warmer earth will be.,11
0,I selected these answers because I felt that these were the best choices,12
0,I guessed,13
0,Because if the sun was directly facing the ground I would melt the snow a lot quicker.,14
0,I selected answer C because in the first one seems to be ,15
1,the first one is sighing down straight.then the second one is slant side ways  ,16
0,I chose this answer because one is going up more than the other so i piked 1 spring and two summer. ,17
0,I choose that answer because the picture shows that where the sun is and kinda how much pressure the sun putting down.,18
0,the sun is covering less for the first one so I thought winter the second one cover more so I thought summer,19
0,I chose this answer because in winter we don't get as much sunlight unlike summer.,20
1,because the suns rays in diagram 2 are technically closer to the earth providing more warmth and sunlight / ,21
0,I guest.,22
0,because its hot and warm air that is shown on the picture and the only answers on their that are hot and cold our summer and spring / ,23
1,"I selected the answer because in the summer the sun sits directly on you, and the summer is the opposite of the winter, and since the sun cant be on the earth It goes slightly to the side.",24
0,this is the correct answer because the seasons go in order so if it starts out as one then it goes to the next but in this case the first one is winter because it does not goes to the left or right it is just straight so it is winter and the second one is summer because it casts a shadow ,25
0,2 summer because the sun represents a lot of heat and when heat becomes down to a surface of something it becomes hot and the more we have sunlight and hot days the more we have 2 summers. /  / 1 winter 1 winter because when we have something  cold shining on a surface it gets super cold and while we have that it freezes so while we have more summer and stuff we have less winter days.,26
0,Because the sun in spring is higher in the sky because it is not as hot as summer,27
0,the sun isn't providing direct sunlight the whole time so when it isn't it is cold enough for snowy weather which is winter.,28
1,the first sun is pointing to the ground so more direct but more area to cover the second sun is pointing wider than the first so less area to cover / ,29
0,its the only one that works with the pattern of the suns,30
0,because summer is when u get the most sunlight and in the winter you will have sunlight but not a lot  ,31
0,I choose this answer because  the sun looked farther away the other pic looked closer.,32
0,because in the first picture the suns far away from earth so its going to be cold. in the second picture the sun is closer so its going to be warmer because the rays are closer.,33
0,I think this because in the first picture the sun is almost directly on and on the second picture because it is spread out for summer,34
0,"I selected this answer because sun one is looking straight to the earth's surface so that would explain winter, sun two is looking not straight and that would cause the earth's surface to be two spring.",35
0,"I didn't know, I just guessed, but I did narrow it down to two because I knew 2 option go in the right order of the season.",36
0,i picked this because its the one that made the most sence,37
0,I think it is #1 because in the winter the snow doesn't melt as fast and it really only melts in one spot at a time and in the summer its warm everywhere.,38
0,I choose this answer because the sun is shining its rays on the surface which makes it warm so I assumed it was in the warm seasons that's why I picked spring and summer for this question.,39
0,"Because it is above the green surface, signifying spring, and then to the side, signifying Summer.",40
0,because that's all I could think of,41
0,"if you imagine the picture of the 4 seasons while the earth goes around the sun, spring ,summer,autumn,winter in that order is the seasons 1 is spring because it is at the top left of the diagram and summer is on the top right so in that case it is 1-Spring, 2-Summer ",42
0,I selected this answer because it explained the scenario. Spring must come before summer can.,43
0,I figured that in the spring the sun will be not directly above the earth but more in a diagonal position,44
0,I don't really know why I selected this answer. It was really hard and I don't know. I just kind of guessed and thought of what I think the sun looks like in the winter and summer.,45
0,I selected this answer because,46
1,More sun on surface,47
0,"I picked 2-Summer because the sun was beaming over the Earth at an angle, causing the heat radiation waves to be directly flowing towards our bodies from an angle. I wasn't sure about the first image so I guess between 1-Spring and 1-Winter because the second option was 2-Summer.",48
0,I chose this answer because in the first picture the sun looks further-cold / In the second picture it looked closer-warmer / 1=winter  / 2=summer,49
0,I think it is 1 spring 2 summer because the sun is shining on the earth.,50
1,1 is winter because the sun is direct while number 2 is summer because the sun covers a wide range of area,51
1,because winter sun is straight up summer sun is at a angle so the heat becomes more hotter,52
0,"I picked Winter first and Summer second because Winter is cold so sunlight isn't spread out much, but in the Summer it's warm so sunlight is spread out.",53
0,because the first one the sun light are more direct to the earth and the second one is less direct which  means less heat ,54
0,I selected these because I think that winter would deflect more light and spring would consume more sun which intern  would make the sun less perpendicular with the earth,55
0,In the winter the sun beats down directly but does not give the warmth to the earth like in the summer.,56
0,"     the sun, in this picture represents where the sun is in the seasons. as I drew out the picture again, I realized that the sun points different ways when turned at a specific spot. At these points is spring and summer because the sun is fairly close together indicating that the seasons need to be closer together as spring and summer are. the other seasons are to spread apart like winter and spring, winter and summer, or summer and winter are all opposite seasons. there for the sun would be spread out more, at different angles in the sky.",57
0,The green circle represent when when it`s spring out side and the other circle is summer.,58
1,I picked question number three because the second one has more sun rays spread out showing that there is more sun and the first one shows that the sun rays don't cover as much but still cover some.,59
0,yellow is the energy and the energy is bouncing at different angles during the different seasons.,60
0,spring is normal summer is hot,61
0,in winter you can not see your shadow but in summer you can see your shadow.,62
0,"spring has a warm weather ,and during the summer we get closer to the sun so we get it's full blast.",63
0,I guessed  / ,64
0,because it looked right / ,65
1,"I think that the first picture is winter and the second picture is summer because the in picture 1, the sun is further away from the Earth's surface because of the Earth's tilt and rotation. This means that the first picture is in the northern hemisphere and close to the winter solstice. So, picture 2 would be close to the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere because the sun is the closest to earth.",66
1,because the sun in winter it's more higher than the other one and in spring the sun isn't that high up but it also depends if it's morning or in the after noon,67
1,The sun in the summer hits earth directly,68
0, the earth spins and the sun orbits when that is happening the earth is at an angle therefor the sunlight does not shine directly on the earths surface ,69
0,i selected this question because i think spring the sun is a little off and in summer it shines almost sideways.  ,70
0,the second one was diagonal so it was either spring or fall,71
0,"I selected this answer because more sunlight seems to be hitting the earths surface for figure two, while figure one seemed to have less sunlight hitting the Earth.",72
0,"I chose this answer because, of how far away the sun is from Earths surface affects how hot it is. The temperature is part of how we choose the seasons. The closer the sun is the hotter it will be on Earth.",73
0,The long lines are the summer and short lines are winter and the long lines are on both and the short lines are in on one.,74
0,because one is fare a way and the other is closer /  ,75
0,"I selected this answer because the picture does not show snow so I don't think there is winter. I think that there is two summer because the sun is out both times and in spring, there is also time where the sun is out. ",76
0,it looks like it and the start of the year is when he sun is up,77
0,"The first sun Is shining more directly at the earth in a certain area trying to provide as much sunlight as possible, it is higher because in winter time we are farther away from the sun. The second sun is shining more closely since in the spring were closer to the sun both in each north and south.",78
0,"I selected this answer because in figure 1 it shows how the suns rays aren't covering much ground,and that made me think that it is probably not that warm so I got to the conclusion that figure 1 is winter. Now in figure 2 it shows the suns rays covering all of the ground and that made me think that it must be very warm with the sun touching every thing. So that got me to the conclusion of it being summer time in figure 2. This is my explanation of why I picked choice A.",79
0,Because the summer is covering the earths surface.,80
0,beacue I gussed b,81
0,because summer is more worth then winter that's why winter is not dorect ,82

0,I guessed ,230
0,how the sun is placed because if theres a lot of sun it must be summer and if theres hardly no sun it must be winter / ,231
0,in the first one the sun is father away from the earth and the one is closer it the earth ,232
0,there is one winter each year and you get summer twice,233
0,I believe that the 1st picture is winter & the 2nd one is summer because during the summer months I feel as if the sun is at a further distance than in the winter months. Therefore I chose number 2 for summer because the sun is at a slant.,234
0,Number one is pointing directly on the earths surface and number two is pointing at an angle and I think when the sun is pointing directly down the sun isn't as hot.,235
0,I picked the fourth question because in example number one is more together but it douses not cover the entire ground but while number two is more sped out.    ,236
0,I thin the answer is Spring then Summer because the farther away the sun is from earth the colder it is. The closer the sun is to earth the warmer earth will be.,237

0,I guessed,239
0,Because if the sun was directly facing the ground I would melt the snow a lot quicker.,240
0,I selected answer C because in the first one seems to be ,241
0,the first one is sighing down straight.then the second one is slant side ways  ,242
0,I chose this answer because one is going up more than the other so i piked 1 spring and two summer. ,243
0,I choose that answer because the picture shows that where the sun is and kinda how much pressure the sun putting down.,244
0,the sun is covering less for the first one so I thought winter the second one cover more so I thought summer,245
0,I chose this answer because in winter we don't get as much sunlight unlike summer.,246
0,because the suns rays in diagram 2 are technically closer to the earth providing more warmth and sunlight / ,247
0,I guest.,248
0,because its hot and warm air that is shown on the picture and the only answers on their that are hot and cold our summer and spring / ,249
0,"I selected the answer because in the summer the sun sits directly on you, and the summer is the opposite of the winter, and since the sun cant be on the earth It goes slightly to the side.",250
0,this is the correct answer because the seasons go in order so if it starts out as one then it goes to the next but in this case the first one is winter because it does not goes to the left or right it is just straight so it is winter and the second one is summer because it casts a shadow ,251
0,2 summer because the sun represents a lot of heat and when heat becomes down to a surface of something it becomes hot and the more we have sunlight and hot days the more we have 2 summers. /  / 1 winter 1 winter because when we have something  cold shining on a surface it gets super cold and while we have that it freezes so while we have more summer and stuff we have less winter days.,252
0,Because the sun in spring is higher in the sky because it is not as hot as summer,253
0,the sun isn't providing direct sunlight the whole time so when it isn't it is cold enough for snowy weather which is winter.,254
0,the first sun is pointing to the ground so more direct but more area to cover the second sun is pointing wider than the first so less area to cover / ,255
0,its the only one that works with the pattern of the suns,256
0,because summer is when u get the most sunlight and in the winter you will have sunlight but not a lot  ,257
0,I choose this answer because  the sun looked farther away the other pic looked closer.,258
0,because in the first picture the suns far away from earth so its going to be cold. in the second picture the sun is closer so its going to be warmer because the rays are closer.,259
0,I think this because in the first picture the sun is almost directly on and on the second picture because it is spread out for summer,260

0,More sun on surface,273
0,"I picked 2-Summer because the sun was beaming over the Earth at an angle, causing the heat radiation waves to be directly flowing towards our bodies from an angle. I wasn't sure about the first image so I guess between 1-Spring and 1-Winter because the second option was 2-Summer.",274
0,I chose this answer because in the first picture the sun looks further-cold / In the second picture it looked closer-warmer / 1=winter  / 2=summer,275
0,I think it is 1 spring 2 summer because the sun is shining on the earth.,276
0,1 is winter because the sun is direct while number 2 is summer because the sun covers a wide range of area,277
0,because winter sun is straight up summer sun is at a angle so the heat becomes more hotter,278
0,"I picked Winter first and Summer second because Winter is cold so sunlight isn't spread out much, but in the Summer it's warm so sunlight is spread out.",279
0,because the first one the sun light are more direct to the earth and the second one is less direct which  means less heat ,280
0,I selected these because I think that winter would deflect more light and spring would consume more sun which intern  would make the sun less perpendicular with the earth,281

0,because the suns rays in diagram 2 are technically closer to the earth providing more warmth and sunlight / ,457
0,I guest.,458
0,because its hot and warm air that is shown on the picture and the only answers on their that are hot and cold our summer and spring / ,459
0,"I selected the answer because in the summer the sun sits directly on you, and the summer is the opposite of the winter, and since the sun cant be on the earth It goes slightly to the side.",460
0,this is the correct answer because the seasons go in order so if it starts out as one then it goes to the next but in this case the first one is winter because it does not goes to the left or right it is just straight so it is winter and the second one is summer because it casts a shadow ,461
0,2 summer because the sun represents a lot of heat and when heat becomes down to a surface of something it becomes hot and the more we have sunlight and hot days the more we have 2 summers. /  / 1 winter 1 winter because when we have something  cold shining on a surface it gets super cold and while we have that it freezes so while we have more summer and stuff we have less winter days.,462
0,Because the sun in spring is higher in the sky because it is not as hot as summer,463
0,the sun isn't providing direct sunlight the whole time so when it isn't it is cold enough for snowy weather which is winter.,464
0,the first sun is pointing to the ground so more direct but more area to cover the second sun is pointing wider than the first so less area to cover / ,465
0,its the only one that works with the pattern of the suns,466
0,because summer is when u get the most sunlight and in the winter you will have sunlight but not a lot  ,467
0,I choose this answer because  the sun looked farther away the other pic looked closer.,468
0,because in the first picture the suns far away from earth so its going to be cold. in the second picture the sun is closer so its going to be warmer because the rays are closer.,469
0,I think this because in the first picture the sun is almost directly on and on the second picture because it is spread out for summer,470
0,"I selected this answer because sun one is looking straight to the earth's surface so that would explain winter, sun two is looking not straight and that would cause the earth's surface to be two spring.",471
0,"I didn't know, I just guessed, but I did narrow it down to two because I knew 2 option go in the right order of the season.",472
0,i picked this because its the one that made the most sence,473
0,I think it is #1 because in the winter the snow doesn't melt as fast and it really only melts in one spot at a time and in the summer its warm everywhere.,474
0,I choose this answer because the sun is shining its rays on the surface which makes it warm so I assumed it was in the warm seasons that's why I picked spring and summer for this question.,475
0,"Because it is above the green surface, signifying spring, and then to the side, signifying Summer.",476
0,because that's all I could think of,477
0,"if you imagine the picture of the 4 seasons while the earth goes around the sun, spring ,summer,autumn,winter in that order is the seasons 1 is spring because it is at the top left of the diagram and summer is on the top right so in that case it is 1-Spring, 2-Summer ",478
0,I selected this answer because it explained the scenario. Spring must come before summer can.,479
0,I figured that in the spring the sun will be not directly above the earth but more in a diagonal position,480
0,I don't really know why I selected this answer. It was really hard and I don't know. I just kind of guessed and thought of what I think the sun looks like in the winter and summer.,481
0,I selected this answer because,482
0,More sun on surface,483
0,"I picked 2-Summer because the sun was beaming over the Earth at an angle, causing the heat radiation waves to be directly flowing towards our bodies from an angle. I wasn't sure about the first image so I guess between 1-Spring and 1-Winter because the second option was 2-Summer.",484
0,I chose this answer because in the first picture the sun looks further-cold / In the second picture it looked closer-warmer / 1=winter  / 2=summer,485
0,I think it is 1 spring 2 summer because the sun is shining on the earth.,486
0,1 is winter because the sun is direct while number 2 is summer because the sun covers a wide range of area,487
0,because winter sun is straight up summer sun is at a angle so the heat becomes more hotter,488
0,"I picked Winter first and Summer second because Winter is cold so sunlight isn't spread out much, but in the Summer it's warm so sunlight is spread out.",489
0,because the first one the sun light are more direct to the earth and the second one is less direct which  means less heat ,490
0,I selected these because I think that winter would deflect more light and spring would consume more sun which intern  would make the sun less perpendicular with the earth,491
0,In the winter the sun beats down directly but does not give the warmth to the earth like in the summer.,492
0,"     the sun, in this picture represents where the sun is in the seasons. as I drew out the picture again, I realized that the sun points different ways when turned at a specific spot. At these points is spring and summer because the sun is fairly close together indicating that the seasons need to be closer together as spring and summer are. the other seasons are to spread apart like winter and spring, winter and summer, or summer and winter are all opposite seasons. there for the sun would be spread out more, at different angles in the sky.",493
0,The green circle represent when when it`s spring out side and the other circle is summer.,494
0,I picked question number three because the second one has more sun rays spread out showing that there is more sun and the first one shows that the sun rays don't cover as much but still cover some.,495
0,yellow is the energy and the energy is bouncing at different angles during the different seasons.,496
0,spring is normal summer is hot,497
0,in winter you can not see your shadow but in summer you can see your shadow.,498
0,"spring has a warm weather ,and during the summer we get closer to the sun so we get it's full blast.",499
0,I guessed  / ,500
0,because it looked right / ,501
0,"I think that the first picture is winter and the second picture is summer because the in picture 1, the sun is further away from the Earth's surface because of the Earth's tilt and rotation. This means that the first picture is in the northern hemisphere and close to the winter solstice. So, picture 2 would be close to the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere because the sun is the closest to earth.",502
0,because the sun in winter it's more higher than the other one and in spring the sun isn't that high up but it also depends if it's morning or in the after noon,503
0,The sun in the summer hits earth directly,504
0, the earth spins and the sun orbits when that is happening the earth is at an angle therefor the sunlight does not shine directly on the earths surface ,505
0,i selected this question because i think spring the sun is a little off and in summer it shines almost sideways.  ,506

0,there is one winter each year and you get summer twice,513
0,I believe that the 1st picture is winter & the 2nd one is summer because during the summer months I feel as if the sun is at a further distance than in the winter months. Therefore I chose number 2 for summer because the sun is at a slant.,514
0,Number one is pointing directly on the earths surface and number two is pointing at an angle and I think when the sun is pointing directly down the sun isn't as hot.,515
